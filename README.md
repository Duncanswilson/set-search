# set-search
currently `set_searcher2_cursor.py` is the best iteration I've done of the algorithm for finding maximal set configurations for $n$ cards.
## status of things 
as it stands, the search is broken for $n > 2$. for $n=3$ it only finds 9 line configurations and for $n=4$ it only finds 12 line configurations.
